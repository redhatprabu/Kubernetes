No black magic is required, just a bit of yaml.

Write the yaml to deploy a DaemonSet (just use an nginx image) and then test it to be sure it gets deployed on each node.  Delete the pods when you've completed this exorcism.  Er... Exercise.


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: cthulu
  labels:
    daemon: "yup"
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      daemon: "pod"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        daemon: pod
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
        effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
      - name: cthulu-jr
        image: nginx
