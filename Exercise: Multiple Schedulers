Pods generally are scheduled by the default scheduler, and their yaml might look like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotation-default-scheduler
  labels:
    name: multischeduler
spec:
  schedulerName: default-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: pod-container
    image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:2.0
Ordinarily, we don't need to specify the scheduler's name in the spec because everyone uses a single default one. Sometimes, however, developers need to have custom schedulers in charge of placing pods due to legacy or specialized hardware constraints.

Rewrite the yaml for this pod so it makes use of a scheduler called custom-scheduler, and annotate the pod accordingly.



ANS : 


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotation-default-scheduler
  labels:
    name: multischeduler
  annotations:
    scheduledBy: custom-scheduler
spec:
  schedulerName: custom-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: pod-container
    image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:2.0
