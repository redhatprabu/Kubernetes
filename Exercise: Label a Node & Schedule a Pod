1. Pretend that node 3 is your favorite node.  Maybe it's got all SSDs.  Maybe it's got a fast network or a GPU.  Or maybe it sent you a nice tweet.  Label this node in some way so that you can schedule a pod to it.


 kubectl  label node arshadalisyed3.mylabserver.com best=node3
 


2. Create a yaml for a busybox sleeper/restarter that will get scheduled to your favorite node from #1.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command:
      - sleep
      - "300"
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  restartPolicy: Always
  nodeSelector:
    best: node3
